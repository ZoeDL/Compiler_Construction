This directory contains the source code for the ILOC 
optimizer, as used in COMP 506, Spring 2016 semester.

Makefile:

	make opt    -- builds the optimizer

	make clean  -- removes temporary files from the directory

Using the optimizer:

1. make opt
2. using cmd:

    opt [flags] file_name

    you should select at least one, or both two optimizations in flags:

    -v: value numbering
    -u: loop unrolling
    -i: loop-invariant code motion (not implemented)

    you can specify the orders which the optimizations excute.

    Examples:
        ./opt -u ./abc.i
        ./opt -u -v ./abc.i
        ./opt -v -u ./abc.i
